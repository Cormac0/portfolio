   abstract = {We propose a ten-year Mars mission to establish Earth-independence and support efficient , safe, and sustainable science and exploration goals. The campaign begins with a series of precursor missions, starting with the Artemis program, followed by robotic missions to perform site surveys and selection, de-risk technologies, and to start stockpiling in-situ water and propellant. Robotic Cargo Starships would depart first in 2035 to deliver and deploy approximately 5,800 tons of habitats, nuclear microreactors, farm modules, manufacturing and ISRU systems. In 2040, two Crew Starships carrying 36 persons would land on Mars to establish two close-proximity villages. The lifecycle cost is estimated at $81 billion, with a peak annual cost of $6.6 billion. To meet RASCAL competition requirements, intended to motivate the exploration of highly self-reliant architecture concepts, resupply from Earth was constrained to only 5 metric tons every two years and minimum surface endurance was set at 7 years. The risks to human life and to critical systems increase exponentially over a minimally-resupplied, 7-10 year mission to Mars. Our approach focused on identifying capabilities to mitigate known and unknown risks. Using a high-fidelity crew time model, we found that large architectures, with their economies of scale and productivity gains from specialization, are essential to robustly support the necessary capabilities. The model also shows that small 7-year missions of 12 persons or less cannot provide value in terms of free surface traverse time for science and exploration. Given the necessity of a large, complex architecture, we then sought out efficiencies and synergies (value engineering) in order to make the mission feasible and affordable. In the process, we identified more benefits that are enabled only by large missions, including the creation of a true community on Mars with sufficient social complexity for humans to thrive, and the geopolitically compelling option to include crew from every Artemis Accords signatory in the first human mission to Mars. When history comes calling, the United States and its international partners are capable of rising to the challenge of large logistical campaigns: the Berlin Airlift and the D-Day Normandy landings were large not by choice, but by the need of assurance of mission success. The challenge we address with Pale Red Dot is to provide a rationale, design and project plan for a necessarily large and complex, yet effective, feasible and affordable campaign.},

   abstract = {NASA is interested in characterising and robotically exploring the lunar permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) in advance of Artemis crewed landings. The challenging terrain of these regions means a lander would only be able to access the rim of a PSR, limiting line-of-sight communication and sensing into the PSR. Autonomously deployed lunar tower infrastructures could provide valuable lines of sight into and around these PSRs. NASA has developed deployable composite booms for use in microgravity, and we propose an extension of those capabilities by deploying a composite boom vertically in the lunar gravity field. Services hosted by the elevated platform at the top of the boom, such as power beaming, radio repeaters, or imagers, could support the near-term operations of multiple distributed, mobile, robotic assets as well as long-term regional operations of exploration crews. The Multifunctional Expandable Lunar Lightweight, Tall Tower (MELLTT) design, created by our interdisciplinary team of MIT graduate and undergraduate students in October 2019, has been selected and funded by NASA STMD and Space Grant as a finalist in the National Institute of Aerospace’s NASA BIG Idea 2020 Challenge and will be demonstrated at the virtual BIG Idea Forum in January 2021. The expected result of this work is a proof-of-concept of a TRL 4 prototype of a deployable, tall lunar tower by January 2021, setting the stage for future development along a path to flight targeting an early 2020’s lunar tower technology demonstration mission in support of the Artemis program.},

   abstract = {While manufacturing heavy and large machinery, the insertion of crane-hung heavy parts into horizontal holes is often required. This paper presents a method outlining the horizontal insertion of a ring onto a shaft using a gantry crane with a single cable attachment. We exploit the underactuated nature of the single-cable crane system to prevent the hung object from being over-constrained, and allow it to gently interact with the shaft. Simply measuring the tilt angle of the ring with an IMU as it interacts with the shaft face allows a robotic crane to estimate the direction of misalignment of the ring relative to the shaft. A 3D kinematic analysis of this tilting process is performed to obtain the conditions under which the tilting angle can be measured stably. Based on the analysis, a recursive procedure for reducing the misalignment is obtained, and its convergence conditions are discussed. Furthermore, the conditions for jamming-free horizontal insertion are obtained. The autonomous horizontal insertion method is implemented on an overhead crane robot to verify the algorithm and demonstrate the feasibility.},

   abstract = {In heavy industries, large, heavy objects must be tumbled to access features on their bottoms and sides for assembly and maintenance. Traditional manual operations using a single-cable crane are high-risk, and difficult for less experienced workers. Automating the tumbling process is made challenging due to the presence of kinematic and static singularities which are shown to occur when a single-cable crane loses control over the block being tumbled. Here, an autonomous method for safely tumbling a heavy block sitting on a surface using a two-cable crane is presented. Two winches controlling a pair of cables on a crane are coordinated in such a way that a) the block cannot slip on the floor, b) the block is not lifted into the air, and c) the block is under quasi-static balanced control at all times. A control algorithm for coordinating the two winches is developed for safely tumbling a block without slipping or becoming airborne as well as for eliminating the effect of singularities. A small-scale prototype is developed and the control algorithm is implemented and evaluated experimentally.},
