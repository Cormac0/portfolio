I'm a graduate student working towards my PhD at the d'Arbeloff Lab in MIT. My research is focused on the design and development of autonomous cranes. I am interested in how underactuated systems, such as cranes, can leverage contact with their environment to perform complex and dexterous manipulation tasks. Outside of my immediate research, I have been involved with student-run teams designing technology for lunar exploration as a part of NASA's BIG Idea Challenge.
